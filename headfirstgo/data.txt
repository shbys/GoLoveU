The Scan method on bufio.Scanner 
is designed to be used as part of a for loop. 
It will read a single line of text from the file, 
returning true if it read
data successfully and false if it did not. 
If Scan is used as the condition on
a for loop, the loop will continue running as 
long as there is more data to
be read. Once the end of the file is reached (or thereâ€™s an error), 
Scan will return false , 
and the loop will exit.
After calling the Scan method on the bufio.Scanner , 
calling the Text
method returns a string with the data that was read. 
For this program, 
we simply call Println within the loop to print each line out.
