/*
By convention, a getter method's name should be the same
as the name of the field or variable it accesses.
Of course, if you want the method to be exported,
its name will need to start with a capital letter.
Getter methods don't need to modify the receiver at all,
so we could use the value receiver.
But if any method on a type takes a pointer receiver,
convention says that all should, for consistency's sake,
use all pointer receiver or value receiver.
